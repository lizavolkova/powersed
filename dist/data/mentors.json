  "summary": "I am a data scientist at Brandwatch, a social media monitoring platform. My primary focus is on modeling, analyzing, and visualizing large-scale social networks.\n\nBefore Brandwatch I was a postdoc in the math department at Columbia University. I earned my PhD in math from Penn State; my research lay at the intersection of geometry, topology, and operator K-theory. I became interested in data science while at Columbia, particularly as a source of applications of spectral theory and large-scale geometry.\n\nI've been coding off and on since middle school, though without much formal education. Unless staring at examples and asking stackoverflow questions counts as \"education\".",
